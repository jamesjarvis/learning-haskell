CO663 Class - Learning Haskell

## Outline

So, I think I actually did a bit of Haskell back in 2017/18 when we were doing a lot of Erlang. But, I didn't really know about GitHub back then and thus have lost all of my work. So, here we go again.

This is all based on the tutorials from [http://learn.hfm.io/](http://learn.hfm.io/)

## RUN LOCALLY

First, you're gonna need Haskell installed.

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)

Or if you are on MacOS like I was, just run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```
